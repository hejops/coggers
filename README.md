# coggers

This is an attempted rewrite of [`dita`](https://github.com/hejops/dita), which
is a command-line interface for automated mp3 file tagging using data from
[Discogs](http://www.discogs.com/), inspired by the
[foo_discogs](https://bitbucket.org/zoomorph/foo_discogs/src/master/) component
for [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/).

Aside from replicating all basic functionality of `dita`, additional objectives
include:

- More robust/explicit error handling
- More comprehensive documentation and unit testing
- Improved cross-platform support
- Improved configurability
- A fully fledged TUI
